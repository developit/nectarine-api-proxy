# [Nectarine] API Proxy

> A ridiculously simple off-the-shelf CORS proxy for the Peach API.

You won't find endpoints or anything here, this is just a proxy that allows access to Peach via CORS.

It's being open-sourced in the name of transparency, so you can see your data is safe when you use [Nectarine].
